# Invite Deleter
This is a bot that takes care of spambots attacking Discord servers that use invite links in their nicknames, banning them from all possible servers.

You can self-host it, but I do not provide support for it yet. You can invite the my public version of the bot (highly reccomended) with [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=493299837358440468&permissions=3076&scope=bot).
