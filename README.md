This is a powerful Discord bot based on a mutual help system to keep servers safe by banning a spam account from every server it's in either by automated or manual action. This will also decrease the rate of future spam attacks in involved servers.

You can self-host it, but there's no support provided for it. You can invite the public version of the bot (highly reccomended) with [this link](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=493299837358440468&permissions=314437&scope=bot).
